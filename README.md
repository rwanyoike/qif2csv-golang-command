# Qif to CSV Converter

This Go program converts a Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) file to a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. It takes a QIF file as input and outputs the corresponding CSV data to `stdout`.

## Limitations

This program handles basic QIF file formats. It may not work with more complex or non-standard QIF files.
